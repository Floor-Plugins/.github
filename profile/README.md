# Floor Plugins
Ever wanted a Minecraft plugin that leaves out no customization options, has no performance issues, accepts community edits? Well, we make them!

All _Floor Plugins_ are started by [boyninja1555@github.com](https://github.com/boyninja1555), and are worked on alongside invited contributors and the community.

We all know about the largest issue with most Minecraft server plugins: **They are not always customizable!** For example, let's say you want to change the message prefixes of the plugin to something more understandable. Some prefixes don't even explain what's happening! However, our plugins leave out **absolutely no customization options**. Don't like how a message is worded? Change it! Want to confuse players with a mismatching message prefix? You can do it! Need to **completely** revamp parts of the plugin? Just look around the configuration!
